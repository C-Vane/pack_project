### Technology Stack

For this project, I have chosen the following technologies:

- Framework: Next.js

  - I chose Next.js because it provides a simplified development process and allows for easy creation and deployment of full-stack web apps. Additionally, Next.js has built-in server-side rendering capabilities, which can improve page loading times and SEO performance.
